itrSurv is an R package to estimate optimal individualized treatment regimes for various survival endpoints. The authors introduce an multi-utility value function that determine the optimal rule via prioritizing survival while also accounting for a secondary endpoint.
itrSurv works for multiple treatment options, but is only applicable to the single stage disease setting. Please refer to our papers for technical details.

Currently, itrSurv is only applicable to competing risks with a priority cause of interest (as of May 2024), and recurrent events (on-going, as of July 2024).

This is the doctoral dissertation thesis work of Christina W Zhou under the mentorship of Michael R Kosorok at UNC-CH Department of Biostatistics.
