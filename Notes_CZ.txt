First, build source .tar.gz file from .RProj on local machine, then copy to cluster location. Then, unzip the file by doing the following:
1) go to the folder that has the R scripts you want to run
2) open R by typing R (make sure you module load r/X.X.X the right version)
3) type: install.packages('[location of .tar.gz file]/itrSurv_0.1.0.tar.gz', repos = NULL, type='source')
4) library(itrSurv)
5) exit and run bash CR_S2run.sh

! If package is ONLY binary and not source, then go to DESCRIPTION and delete the line with "BUILT" and "PACKAGED"

Local machine: scp itrSurv_0.1.0.tar.gz cwzhou@longleaf.unc.edu:/nas/longleaf/home/cwzhou/Dissertation/Paper_1/.
! In cluster:
cd /nas/longleaf/home/cwzhou/Dissertation/Analyses/Simulations/Paper1_CR
Open R and type: install.packages('/nas/longleaf/home/cwzhou/Dissertation/Paper_1/itrSurv_0.1.0.tar.gz', repos = NULL, type = 'source')
